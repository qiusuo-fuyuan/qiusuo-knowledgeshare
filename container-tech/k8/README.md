This tutorial contains the analysis of how K8 Pod, Services, Deployments work
on local system. The goal is able to access cluster via Cluster-IP from host



First define deployments. We have created one deployment

docker exect -it minikube-docker-container


API Server is running on the master node of cluster
####get API-Server Kube#####

root@minikube:/# docker ps | grep kube-apiserver

By default, there is one Cluster, this Cluster uses the Minikube as the node. In one node, there can be multiple pods running.
